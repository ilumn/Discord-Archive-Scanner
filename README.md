# Discord-Archive-Scanner

Python Script Designed to scan a json file archive of a discord channel or dm that was created with Discord-Chat-Exporter

Works by creating a thread for each string that you would like to search for

## Installation:

1) create a list.py file with an array named "strings" and place that in the same directory as the downloaded search.py file

2) the script will then create two text file for each string in the array: one that tells the number of times the string was found, and another that contains every instance of that string
